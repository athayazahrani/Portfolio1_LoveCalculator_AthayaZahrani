# Athaya Zahrani Irmansyah - Portfolio Project Module 1 - A Simple Game: Love Calculator

A "Love Calculator" is a playful tool often used to calculate the compatibility between two people based on their names or other inputs. It's typically designed for entertainment purposes, providing a percentage or score that suggests how "compatible" the two individuals might be. The idea behind this tool is rooted in algorithms that donâ€™t reflect real-life compatibility, but people enjoy using it for fun. These calculators can be found as apps or online, and may include additional features like zodiac sign matching or personality quizzes for a more detailed result.

The Love Calculator that I created works by calculating the compatibility percentage based on mathematical analysis of the letters in the names, ages, zodiac signs, and three romantic questions that will be asked. This game was created using the **Python programming language as an application of the material in Module 1: Python Programming Fundamentals at JCDS Purwadhika on Site Bandung by applying the use of if-else statements, for loop, and while**. The results are purely for entertainment and should not be taken seriously as an accurate measure of a relationship or real feelings. The creator determines the rules of the Love Calculator game, and the calculator will only display a 100% match when my name and the predetermined name are entered!

_Curious to see how compatible you and your crush really are? Try my Love Calculator now and discover your love match percentage in just a few clicks! It's all fun and games, but you never know what sparks might fly! To run the program, use the '.py' file on this page!_
